    TODO:
[v] 1. Sorting favorites does not change file structure
[v] 2. If set has multiple instances of an audio, only the first instance of buttons is deleted
[v] 3. Sets can be renamed to the same name in the set editor
[v] 4. Sets can be dragged to any position in the favorites list
[v] 5. Allow multiple instances of the same set within the favorites list
[v] 6. Remove instead of Delete for the popup that appears when removing a favorite set

    Maybe:
[ ] Deleting sets not working properly?













    Done:
[v] 4. As I mentioned, there's a little bug with the delete confirmation where it has "Thing Name" as a placeholder
[v] 6. Can we add some more text to full favorites warning? See. 4.png
[v] 7. Let's rename the app from "audio-app" to "SFX-6". I tried renaming the exe file, but that did not work.
[v] 9. How to use should open in user's default browser instead of another chromium window... see 7.png
[v] 10. Is it possible to prevent closing of the dialogue boxes when clicking on the box itself? Clicking on the x or anywhere outside the box should close it, which it does. See 8.png
[v] 11. are we able to alter the wording from "Delete Favorite" to "Remove from Favorites"? See 10.png


    Notes:
[ ] 0. Close Dev Console
I can easily do this when deploying the app.
Let's keep it for now to check for more bugs. We'll do this last, when the app is bug-free.
[ ] 3. I still get the warning for the app when I first load it (see 1.png). Anyway to remove this in the final version?
I have 2 fixes for this.
First off, I changed how the app is built and allegedly that might fix the issue.
Secondly, if that doesn't work, I packaged an installer for the app which should work.
However, the default installation directory is in %APPDATA% and I can't seem to be able to change that.
[ ] 5. In addition to this little bug, the dialogue box doesn't disappear after pressing delete (it does when I press cancel).
I couldn't reproduce this. Let's see if there is an error.
[ ] 8. The Favorites folder is still not populating with the sets for me... see 6.png. Not sure why it's not working for me, but it is for you
I added some extra checks where the error was happening.
I also added some extra console logs, just in case. Let's try again.

    Trouble
[ ] 12. I found another interesting thing.... dragging a set to the library (which cannot happen) can sometimes push the input name of the sfx like in the attached
I haven't found a solution for this. I asked on stackoverflow and I will try to see if anyone can give me an answer.
I'll keep asking around.





v All sounds and sets are loaded on startup
v Volume control from the slider top-right works (works live, while audios are playing too)

v Rename library sound (and changes the file too, saved sets and buttons too)
v Library search works
v Sorting the library works

    v The saved folder structure and buttons change to match it
    v Full sets have an indicator to show they're full
v Sorting sets works

v Favorite set: drag and drop a set to Favorites
    v You can't add more than 6 favorite sets; there's an indicator on the favorites panel that show that
v On click on favorite, it makes it active

v Play sound on click on large button
v Play sound on click on button (both for Library and Saved Sets)
    v Stop audio works, and buttons are responsive

v Make set active on click (and update buttons and name)
v Rename set (renames folder and favorite shortcut)

v Context menus work and deleting works for library audios, saved sets, favorites and buttons




- make some animations for drag/drop
    - Create elements on drag-over, and remove them on drag-leave
    - For all to be nice, we can mark them as .isTemporary and remove them later through multiple calls, just in case it can bug out

- stop using .lnk because that's windows only







[v] 1. make the sound effect draggable only on the drag area. This allows the user to be able to click and drag to select areas of text in the input
[v] 2. make the sets draggable only on the drag area
[v] 3. prevent drag to re-sort within the library 
[v] 4. prevent drag to resort within the sets
[v] 5b. make the file/edit/help dropdowns disappear if the user clicks again on file/edit/help
[v] 5c. there is bug with adding a new set through "File"... it seems to work only 1 out of 5 times
[v] 6. delete/hide desktop.ini from the library and the sets list (see attached)?
[v] *7. user can't change the extension when renaming a sound in the library
[v] 8. add a "delete/clear" button in the search bars if the search bar input is in focus.
[v] 9. make dialogue boxes disappear when click is detected outside of the dialogue box (in addition to the close button in the upper right corner).
[v] 10. we need a refresh button in case the user adds sound files to the "library" folder instead of the through the app while the app is open. We can put the refresh button to the right of the upload button. See attached "renew.svg" 
[v] 11. use a "stop" icon instead of "pause" icon to stop the play of audio
[v] 12. close the sort options dropdown when user clicks on a sort option, or anywhere outside of the dropdown
[v] 13. "escape" key closes any dialogue, dropdown, or context menu
[v] 14. Numbers to the right of "library" and "sets" should reflect number of items in each list
[v] 15. app currently starts with the chrome inspector open... need to close
[v] 16. remove star from left of set name if removed from favorites
[v] 17. Make new set name, "Untitled Set X" instead of "Set-X"
[v] 18. there is an inconsistency where sound files dragged from the library to the set-editor remain grayed out (see attached grayed-out.png)
[v] 20. there is a slight bug where the no-drag symbol can appear in two sets (see bug.png)
[v] 21. dragging and rearranging sets within the favorites list has a nice animation+blue highlight. Can this be done when a sound file is dragged to the sets list or the set editor? And when a set is dragged to the favorites area?
[v] 22. in the set editor, make each button push stop the previous audio and restart it. Currently, it plays multiple times on top of each other
[v] *23. can we do the blue color and drag animation when rearranging sound files within the set editor?
[v] 24. start the volume bar at 50% instead of 100%
[v] 26. any way to prevent buttons in the set editor from being depressed when dragging and rearranging sound files? And also when right-clicking on it?
[v] 27. if user empties a button in the set editor, the text "[Empty]" should turn gray again (see not-gray.png)
[v] 28. let's change width: 90cqw to min-width: 100% in the .deviceEditor class
[v] 30. see "icon.svg" for the app icon. Please let me know if you need a different format
[v] 31. if a user clicks on "delete", there is a pop-up to confirm "yes" or "cancel". 

    Notes
[ ] 19. only allow one instance of a set in the favorites. Currently, I can drag multiple instances to the favorites section, which is problematic because if I change the name of the set, only the last instance in the favorites updates
I couldn't reproduce this and it works as intended for me; perhaps it fixed itself while I fixed other bugs
[ ] 29. the "favorites" folder doesn't seem to be populating (see "favorites.png")
I couldn't reproduce this and it works for me; again, perhaps it got fixed as a side-effect

    Can't Do
[ ] 5. can we add an "Edit" option to the main toolbar at the top between "File" and "Help" that has Undo and Redo? Is it possible to add undo/redo in case the user deletes a set or sound file by mistake?
Feature is too large to include in the project
[ ] *25. can we make the cursor change to a no-drag cursor whenever a sound file or set is in an area that it's not supposed to be (see no-drag.png)
Could not achieve this due to how the cursor works in JavaScript with drag-and-drop
